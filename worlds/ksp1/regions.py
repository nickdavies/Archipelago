"""
Region definitions for KSP1 Archipelago.

Region layout:
  * ``Menu`` — the root; holds non-body locations (KSC biomes, starting
    inventory, body-agnostic Splashdown, victory/threshold events).
  * One region per **tech tree node** (62), connected from Menu with entrance
    rules that enforce: progressive R&D band, cumulative science budget, and
    parent-node dependencies (AND/OR by ``any_to_unlock``).
  * One region per **celestial body** that owns (or transitively parents)
    locations.  Planets connect from Menu; each moon connects from its planet
    region, so a moon is reachable only if its planet is.  Every per-body
    location (mission events, home specials, contract completions) lives in its
    body's region.  A **hidden** body's entrance additionally requires its
    ``Discover`` item; the home body always connects straight from Menu (it is
    the start, never gated behind a possibly-hidden parent).
